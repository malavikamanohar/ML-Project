Here's the README file for your Streamlit application:

# Traffic Prediction App

## Overview

The Traffic Prediction App is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict and analyze traffic congestion in different zones of Berlin. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to provide traffic volume predictions based on user inputs such as date, time, and zone. Additionally, the app offers visualizations and reports to understand traffic patterns and model performance.

## Features

1. **Home**: Welcome page with an overview of the app.
2. **Predict**: Allows users to predict traffic volume based on selected date, time, and zone.
3. **Report**: Displays the model's performance metrics and a comparison between actual and predicted traffic volumes.
4. **Dashboard**: Provides various visualizations to analyze traffic patterns over time, by zone, and other factors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-prediction-app.git
    cd traffic-prediction-app
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the model and data files in the correct directories:
    - `./model/newtraffic_model.pkl` - Pre-trained machine learning model.
    - `./csv/traffic.csv` - Traffic data CSV file.

4. Make sure the `up.sh` script is executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x up.sh
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

## App Structure

### Home
- Displays a welcome message and an image related to traffic congestion.

### Predict
- Users can select a zone, date, and time to get a traffic volume prediction.
- The predicted number of vehicles is displayed along with a relevant image.

### Report
- Shows model performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
- Displays a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted traffic volumes.

### Dashboard
- Provides multiple visualizations to analyze traffic data:
    - Traffic volume over time
    - Traffic volume by zone
    - Average traffic volume by hour of the day
    - Average traffic volume by day of the week

## Data Preparation

- The data is loaded from `./csv/traffic.csv`.
- The `DateTime` column is converted to datetime format.
- Additional columns for `Year`, `Month`, `Date`, `Hour`, `Day`, `DayOfWeek`, and `HourOfDay` are created for easier analysis and prediction.

## Zone Mapping

A dictionary is used to map numeric zone values to their corresponding names:
```python
zone_mapping = {
    1: 'North Berlin',
    2: 'South Berlin',
    3: 'East Berlin',
    4: 'West Berlin'
}
```

## Error Handling

- The app checks if the model is loaded correctly and displays an error message if there's an issue.
- Validates the time input format and shows an error message for invalid formats.
